            I'm Md Shahriar Hossein, a software engineer focused on <strong>backend development</strong>, with a strong interest in building robust, scalable, and well-architected systems.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            Previously, I worked at DevSpace as a Junior Software Engineer, where I developed 90+ RESTful Laravel API endpoints across multiple projects and led backend efforts for an internal office management system with attendance and leave automation.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            In addition to professional work, Iâ€™ve developed full-featured personal projects including an e-learning platform and a university automation system, both built from scratch using raw PHP, JavaScript, and Tailwind. These helped me deeply understand database design, role-based access, real-time feedback systems, and third-party integrations like SSLCommerz.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            Whether it's crafting optimized queries, building reusable components, or collaborating across teams, I aim to write code that's clean, maintainable, and built to scale.
